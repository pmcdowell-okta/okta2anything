### Description

Okta2Anything is a simple LDAP Proxy which allows someone to have the Okta
IDAAS Service authenticate against almost anything.

This code is based on the great work by: https://github.com/vjeantet/ldapserver

### *Disclaimer*

*Although it is not uncommon for companies to use LDAP Proxies for authentication, this code is developed for Pilots, Proof of Concepts, and testing.*
*Anyone using this code for production is doing so at their own risk*

### How does it work ?

Okta2Anything acts like an LDAP Service. Using the Okta LDAP Agent, and pointing
the LDAP Agent to Okta2Anything. Okta2Antyhing will delete the authentication
to a local node.js script that will perform the Authentication
